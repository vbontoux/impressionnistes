# What is the Impressionists Race

The Impressionists Race is a regatta that includes 2 distinct events:
- A 21 km half-marathon raced in fours and eights of "all rigging types"
- A 42 km marathon raced in individual boats

## 21 km Half-marathon

### Boats:

- Eight outrigger (racing boat) with coxswain, sweep (one oar per rower) or sculling (two oars per rower)
- Four sweep or sculling, with or without coxswain:
  - With coxswain: outrigger or yolette (recreational boat)
  - Without coxswain: outrigger

### Crews

- Male, female or mixed (Men and Women),
- Distribution of the number of men or women in crews:
  - Rules:
    - A woman can substitute for a man in a male or mixed M/F crew
    - A man cannot substitute for a woman in a female or mixed crew
  - Crew composition (rowers):
    - A male crew comprises more than 50% men
    - A mixed M/F crew comprises at least 1 man and at least 50% women
    - A female crew comprises 100% women

- Age categories: 
  - Here's how the French Rowing Federation (FFA) defines categories by age: 
    -   Youth: any rower aged 14 or under. 
      - J10: aged 10 or under
      - J11: aged 11
      - J12: aged 12
      - J13: aged 13
      - J14: aged 14
    - Junior: any rower aged 15 to 18:
      - J15 = aged 15.  
      - J16 = aged 16.  
      - J17 = aged 17.  
      - J18 = aged 18.  
    - Senior: any rower aged 19 and over
      - Senior under 23: any rower aged 19 to 22 
      - Master (Veteran): any rower aged 27 and over

  - Boat age categories are determined by the average age of the rowers
  - Authorized categories are as follows:
    - For rowers: J16, J18, Senior and Master
    - For coxswains: all previous categories and J14
  - Rules are as follows:
    - Senior categories can accommodate J18 and J16 with an appropriate upgrade certificate
    - J18 category can accommodate J16 with an appropriate upgrade certificate
    - Master category can accommodate seniors as long as the average age remains greater than or equal to 27 years
    - Senior crews can accommodate masters as long as the average age remains under 27 years
    - J16 and J18 cannot row in master crews
    - J14 cannot row, they can only cox
    - Coxswains can row during part of the race, if their passage to the cox seat respects age and authorization criteria as well as the previous mixing criteria => for crews with coxswain, we will define the rowers, an **authorization or not to cox.**

### Boats by categories

Definition of boat notation:
- First position: letter "H" for Male, "F" for Female, "M" for Mixed
- Second position: letter "o" for outrigger or letter "y" for yolette
- Third position: number: number of rowers
- Fourth position: 
  - "x" for sculling boats (two oars per rower)
  - "/" for sweep boats (one oar per rower)
- Fifth position: "-" for boats without coxswain or "+" for boats with coxswain
Example: H4x+ means Male category, 4 rowers sculling with a coxswain

List of categories:
- J16 (for safety reasons, J16 row in boats with coxswain)
  - H4ox+, H4o/+, H8o/+
  - F4ox+, F4o/+, F8o/+
  - M4ox+, M4o/+, M8o/+
- J18
  - H4ox-, H4o/-, H8o/+
  - F4ox-, F4o/-, H8o/+
  - M4ox-, M4o/-, M8o/+
- Seniors
  - H4ox-, H4o/-, H8o/+
  - F4ox-, F4o/-, H8o/+
  - M4ox-, M4o/-, M8o/+
- Master
  - H4yx+, H4y+, H4x+, H4ox-, H4o/-, H8ox+, H8o/+
  - F4yx+, F4y+, F4x+, F4ox-, F4o/-, F8ox+, F8o/+
  - M4yx+, M4y+, M4x+, M4ox-, M4o/-, M8ox+, M8o/+

> **Note:** races are numbered in sequence from this list to establish the preliminary program

### Groupings, classification and rewards

- To limit the number of races according to the number of participants (particularly for races where there is only one competitor), the following groupings may be made:
  - J16 with J18 for the same boat rigging
  - Master with senior for the same boat rigging
  - Sweep with sculling for the same age category and mixing
  - Female with mixed for the same boat rigging
  - Mixed with male for the same boat rigging

> **NB:** handicap criteria established from official regulations (age) or objective statistics (others) may be taken into account.

- A classification is established for each race and a reward is given to the winning crew:
  - Medals and cup, for races where there are several competitors
  - Medals only, for races where there is only one competitor

## 42 km Marathon
The marathon is an individual event in single sculls.

The categories taken into account are as follows:
- Male: senior, master A to H
- Female: senior, master A to H

> **Note:** 42 km races are numbered in sequence from this list according to categories, to establish the preliminary program

# Boat and seat rentals

## Boat rentals
The club offers boats for rent within the limits of their availability.

The boats offered are primarily RCPM boats. We can consider extending rentals by proposing to other clubs to rent their own boats.

We will define in the RCPM fleet a list of boats that can be offered for rental in order to know in advance the quantity that will be available. Clubs will make their request as soon as registrations open.

RCPM rowers have priority on their boats until 15 days before registration closure. After this limit, boats that can be rented, which have not been requested by RCPM crews, will be allocated to clubs that have requested them.

## Seat rentals

Rowers from external clubs who row in mixed club crews, in RCPM crews will have to pay a rental for their seat. This provision is intended to encourage RCPM rowers to form "club" crews.

# Registrations and payments

Registrations are made by a club official (team manager) who opens an account for their structure by entering the information:

- Club name and structure number
- Official name and contact details (email + phone)
- Username, password, MFA

The club official registers their crews and makes any boat rental requests.

There can be several officials for the same club, who open different accounts. These may be rowers who register individually for the Marathon for example.

The club official can make batch registrations (basket) and pay them gradually or at the end, before the closure/payment date.

After the closure date, they can make replacements in crews or declare withdrawals. RCPM can refund boats that are removed due to withdrawal.

Replacements in crews can generate category changes that must be taken into account in the race program.

Registration opening, closure and payment dates:
- Registrations are open from March 19 to April 19 inclusive (we can, if we are ready, advance the opening date to March 1st).
- Payments must be made before April 25 inclusive.
- Withdrawals are only taken into account after the registration closure date.

# Rates

We define the **seat rate**, which includes the coxswain for coxed boats. This rate is the same for crew registrations or boat rentals, except for single sculls for which the rental rate will be higher than the price of a seat (3 times the seat value).

Registration entry

## Principles

### Crew entry for the 21 km race

To enter a crew, the club official enters a race by providing its number.

They are presented with a list of pre-filled options, as well as a list of crew members to fill according to the chosen race:

- Options
  - race number
  - crew number, calculated from race number + number assigned in sequence (unique crew identifier)
  - Category (J16, J18, S, M)
  - Gender mix (H, F, M)
  - Boat: Outrigger / Yolette
  - Rigging: SWEEP / SCULLING
  - Coxswain change during the race

- List of crew members, as appropriate:
  - 4 rowers
  - 4 rowers and 1 coxswain
  - 8 rowers and 1 coxswain

According to the entry made for crew members:
- If the entered crew does not match the gender mix or category criteria of the race:
  - We can offer them to change:
    - The rowers / coxswain
    - The race number
    - The category: we redefine the race number
    - The gender mix: we redefine the race number

- If they made a mistake or want to change, they can modify:
  - The race number
  - The category: we redefine the race number
  - The boat: we redefine the race number
  - The boat rigging: we redefine the race number

If they selected "coxswain change during the race" we indicate for each of the rowers, those who can take the cox seat without changing race (age and gender mix criteria).

At the end, we present them with a summary of their completed registrations which they can return to make modifications or cancellations.

### Participant entry for the Marathon

The official enters information about the rower and gender mix (M/F).

We present them with the corresponding race number for validation.

We define the crew number (race number + sequence number)

## License control

License control is performed separately. For each entered participant, we will note with an indicator, whether the control has been performed or not.

License control can be performed either:
- Automatically, by extracting licenses to verify from the database, then by a batch verification request sent to the FFA site, then return of the result for recording in the database.
- Manually, by asking club officials to register their rowers individually in fictitious races on the FFA server, then by extracting these registrations for injection into the database and control.

# Summary documents

The following documents can be extracted from the database:
1. For club officials: list of registrations, rentals and payments

2. For organizers:
  a. List of registrations (crews and rowers) by club
  b. List of licenses to control
  c. List of rented boats with allocation
  d. Race program (21 km and Marathon)
  e. List of rewards (medals and cups to supply)
  f. Summary of payments by clubs
